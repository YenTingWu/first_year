# Introduction

This project is a demo for my personal blog. 


It now has only completed the frontend part and I'm keeping working on backend with Deno.

In this project, I have used techniques including: 

- TypeScript 
- React x Redux 
- React Hooks 
- reselect
- Sass

## Demo

Show all categories with a brainstorming model in the home page.

In the blog page, it shows all posts from different categories. 

If you want to find the article in the specific category, you are able to select a category with the navigation at the top of the blog page.

Besides, in the right section, it shows the amount of the aritcles.

You are able to write your post with title, description, chapters, categroies, content and the header image in the story page.

In the blog-content page, it allows users to select the specific chapter of the article with the sidebar. 

If users try to edit the article, the icon at the bottom of the sidebar navigates users to the edit page.
